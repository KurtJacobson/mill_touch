==========
Mill Touch
==========

A QtPyVCP interface for a 3 axis mill with a touch screen. I tried to layout
the screen to be as efficient as possible for me. Your needs may be different.

This interface uses the new VTK backplot which is a lot faster and more memory
efficient than Gremlin.

This requires QtPyVCP installed on your system.

To install Mill Touch on your system as is in a termial:
::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jethornton/mill_touch.git


To install Mill Touch and be able to edit and change things in a terminal:
::

    git clone https://github.com/jethornton/mill_touch.git
    cd mill_touch
    pip install -e .
